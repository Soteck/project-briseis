# project-briseis

This is the continuation and rework of https://github.com/Soteck/project-achelois .

Project achelois was an online open-source FPS (rpg class based) that stopped in a point that needed complete rework (that is what happens when you learn while you develop your project). So, I decided to switch to godot and try new things to start over again
